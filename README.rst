Openclean Goes Jupyter
======================

This package provides the framework for using **openclean** in Jupyter Notebooks. For a brief overview please have a look at the `example notebook <https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/openclean-notebook/blob/master/examples/notebooks/Openclean%20Goes%20Jupyter%20-%20Example.ipynb>`_ that shows how to register and run commands.

Note that the package requires the `openclean-core package <https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/openclean-core/>`_ which is currently not installable from PyPI. You have to install `openclean-core` from a local copy of the repository, instead.
